# Farm-Gun

## Description
Main goal of the project was to create a computer game inspired by the board 
game "Super Farmer". The action takes place in a farm, where we raise animals 
such as chickens, ducks, sheep, pigs, cows. The goal of the game is to own 
one animal of each species. Points are counted based on how long the user has 
managed to survive and on the number of animals (the number of points varies
according to the species). Game ends when the user dies.
